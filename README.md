# packet-capture-traffic-analysis
This repository contains my work on packet capture and traffic analysis using Wireshark to inspect network traffic, analyze protocols, and detect threats. It covers ICMP, SSH, FTP/SFTP, WLAN encryption, four-way handshakes, and deauthentication attacks. Includes a full PDF report, packet captures, and key analysis findings.
